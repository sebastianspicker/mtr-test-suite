# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for security-sensitive reports.

Instead, contact the maintainers privately and include:
- a clear description of the issue
- steps to reproduce
- affected versions/commits (if known)
- any suggested fix or mitigation
